# Santarelli Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository includes a collection of my projects and learning experiences throughout my Data Science journey. Here, you'll find various projects that showcase my work in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data visualization**, **machine learning**, and more.

## 🛠 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my skills in data science and provide a clear structure for my ongoing work. This repository will contain several projects, from basic analysis to advanced machine learning models, with each project organized into its own folder for clarity.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **`/EDA/`**: This folder will contain any exploratory data analysis I do.
- **`/visualizations/`**: Any data visualizations created through my projects will go here.
- **`/models/`**: This folder will contain any models used in my projects.
- **`/assets/`**: This folder contains datasets, images, and other resources that are used across the projects.
